With more than 96 percent of ballots counted as of Tuesday
afternoon, Mr. Zelensky’s party, Sluha Narodu ("Servant of
the People") — named after the TV series in which he
starred — appears to have won about 43 percent of the
popular vote and more than 250 of the 424 seats that were
contested. Sluha Narodu is the first party to secure an
outright parliamentary majority since Ukraine became
independent in 1991.

The leading pro-Russia party came in second, and the party
of former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko third. (The
bloc headed by Mr. Poroshenko ranked fourth.) The newbie
party Holos ("Voice"), which is led by a rock star and
denounces the influence of oligarchs and established elites,
is projected to win 20 seats; it is thought to be a natural
ally of Mr. Zelensky’s. An estimated 70 percent of
members-elect are newcomers.
