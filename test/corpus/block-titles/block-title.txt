With more than 96 percent of ballots counted as of Tuesday
afternoon, Mr. Zelensky’s party, Sluha Narodu ("Servant of
the People") — named after the TV series in which he
starred — appears to have won about 43 percent of the
popular vote and more than 250 of the 424 seats that were
contested. Sluha Narodu is the first party to secure an
outright parliamentary majority since Ukraine became
independent in 1991.
